# DAT250 EXPASS1

## Introduction
The goal of the assigment is to create a working Software Development Enviroment needed for the rest of the subject. The main thing we are going to use is [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) which is a Cloud Application Platform that will help us to make Cloud Computation. In my case, I am using a Linux distro, based on ArchLinux, so every explanation will refer to my own case.

## Instalation
First of all, I updated my computer, so everything is up to the lastest version.
