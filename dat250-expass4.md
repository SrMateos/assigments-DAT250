# DAT250 EXPASS4

## Introduction
The goal of the application is to create an API with the spark framework to do the basic CRUD operations with the Todo java class.

## Experiment 1 and 2
All test passed correctly.

## Problems
I didn't have any problemes with JPA as no databases where use. To store every Todo object I used a HashMap. There are no pending issues that I did not manage to solve.
