# DAT250 EXPASS6
## Introduction
The goal of the assigment is to learn how to implementate the MVC model by following a tutorial, as well as creating a SPA web application using the angular framework.

## Problems
The only problem I encountered was about CORS errors. It could be fixed by following a [tutorial](https://www.azilen.com/blog/how-to-resolve-cors-errors-by-using-angular-proxy) mentioned by one of the teachers.
